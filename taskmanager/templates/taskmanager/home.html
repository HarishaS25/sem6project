        The average human functions at optimum always when he/she does one thing at a time with full
        focus. The mind
        can often be bogged down by the thought of multiple tasks of varying importance that remain to be completed
        during the day. To avoid this conundrum, many people hire assistants or secretaries to help with scheduling
        and
        managerial needs. However in this age of automation, the ideal solution is to develop a task manager that acts
        as a virtual assistant to the human, simplifying the whole exercise of planning your day!
        <br>
        <br>
        Our solution is an integrated task manager application that can help effectively manage tasks
        throughout the
        day. The application is packed with features that will help you to keep track and assist with scheduling
        without
        any hassles. We hope you enjoy using our application and find it useful for managing everyday tasks. This
        project was
        built using python's django framework, SqlLite, Bootstrap 5 and html/css. Thank you for visiting.
