      <p class="w-50"> The average human functions at optimum always when he/she does one thing at a time with full
        focus. The mind
        can often be bogged down by the thought of multiple tasks of varying importance that remain to be completed
        during the day. To avoid this conundrum, many people hire assistants or secretaries to help with scheduling
        and
        managerial needs. However in this age of automation, the ideal solution is to develop a task manager that acts
        as a virtual assistant to the human, simplifying the whole exercise of planning your day!</p>
